These is the project files for Clancy, the 2nd generation Arduino-based robot kit designed for beginners with no expereince in Ardiuno robotics.

Inside this repository, there are three main components:
1. Instruction booklet for assembly and operation of the assembled robot
2. Code you need to upload onto the Arduino so it will work as intended
3. 3D printer files to print the chassis that the robot will be built upon

This project was designed with the intention of the user receiving a kit with components prepared as shown in the instruction booklet.
However, if you wish to try this project out yourself, you will need to assemble the chassis and source the parts needed yourself.
